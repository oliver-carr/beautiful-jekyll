## Description

This work was presented at the Physionet Challenge 2017 presented at the Computing in Cardiology conference 2017. The Challenge consisted of classifying short single-lead ECG segments with 10-60 seconds duration into one of the following classes:

| Class  | Description |
| ----- | -------------------:|
| N | normal sinus rhythm |
| A | atrial fibrillation (AF) |
| O | other cardiac rhythms |
| ~ | noise segment |

Two methodologies are proposed and described in distict forlder within this repo:

* Classic feature-based MATLAB approach (`featurebased-approach` folder)
* Deep Convolutional Network Approach in Python (`deeplearn-approach` folder)
