## Quantification of Circadian/Diurnal Rhythms

My work has focussed on methods of quantifying circadian or diurnal rhythms through activity and heart rate signals in order to track deterioration of mental health. Initial work modified Cosinor analysis of fitting sinusoids to total activity, 'sleep', and heart rate signals to quantify their amplitude, phase and average values.

Currently hidden Markov models are being developed to determine the hidden 'inactive' and 'active' states from accelerometry, with circadian covariates to determine average profiles of activity. Longitudinal monitoring of these profiles through accelerometers in mobiles phones may provide information about the changes into depressive states in bipolar disorder.

## Desynchronisation of Rhythms and Links with Mood

Using the Cosinor method of quantifying internal desynchronicity of activity, 'sleep', and heart rate, it was discovered people with borderline personality disorder had the largest shift in phases accross the modalities, suggesting it is a disorder of circadian rhythm. Bipolar disorder participants also had increased internal desynchronicity compared to healthy controls, described [here.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0125-7)

Daily variability of the rhythms were also analysed through the Cosinor method, with strong associations found between diurnal variability and variability of mood, especially in borderline personality disorder, described [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19888-9). These findings suggest diurnal rhythms could be used as an objective marker of mood deterioration in mental health disorders.
