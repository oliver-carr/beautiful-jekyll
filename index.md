### Short Bio

I am a final year DPhil student at the [CIBIM lab](https://cibim.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, using signal processing and machine learning in the monitoring of mental health disorder such as bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

My thesis focuses on monitoring of circadian/diurnal rhythms from passively recorded activity signals, developing methods of quantifying these rhythms and using them to monitor depression in mental health. In addition, I work with ECG recordings to determine the physiological differences in mental health disorders, how cardiac activity alters with mood and mental states, as well as how medication effects physiology. In 2014, I received an MEng degree from the University of Oxford.
