abstract = {The diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF) is a lengthy and expensive procedure that often requires visual inspection of ECG signals by ex-perts. In order to improve patient management and reduce healthcare costs, automated detection of these pathologies is of utmost importance. In this study, we classify short segments of ECG into four classes (AF, normal, other rhythms or noise) as part of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. We compare a state-of-the-art feature-based classifier with a convolutional neural network approach. Both methods were trained using the challenge data, supplemented with an additional database derived from Physionet. The feature-based classifier obtained an F 1 score of 72.0{\%} on the training set (5-fold cross-validation), and 79{\%} on the hidden test set. Similarly, the convolutional neural network scored 72.1{\%} on the augmented database and 83{\%} on the test set. The latter method resulted on a final score of 79{\%} at the competition. Developed routines and pre-trained models are freely available under a GNU GPLv3 license.},
