## Heart Rate Variability in Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder

My work focused on physiological monitoring of participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD).   

A literature review of heart rate variability in BD and BPD was carried out and is available [here.](http://ebmh.bmj.com/content/21/1/23.full.pdf)   


## Linking Changes in Heart Rate Variability to Mood Changes

As part of the Automated Monitoring of Symptom Severity (AMoSS) study (University of Oxford), BD, BPD and healthy participants had ECG signals recorded from 12 to 72 hours as well as self reporting mood scores. Statistically significant correlations were found between [standard measures of HRV and mood scores](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331715).

Fig. Correlations between changes in mood and changes in heart rate variability measures for bipolar disorder (BD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control participants. Statistically significant correlations are shown as a solid line. mRR - mean R-R interval, HF - high frequency power (0.15-0.4Hz), LF - low frequency power (0.04-0.15Hz).
